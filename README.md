Last update: 12th of May, 2018.

All files within this repository are written for the home automation project.
The project is made for the purpose of exploring the possibilities of the RPi.

The project includes (or will include) the following subfolders:

*Surveillance

*Lighting

*Speakers

*Gardening

Each of the folders contains scripts and instructions for hardware and software,
which are used to create the particular automated system.

The list, as well as the project is still to be updated. The goal of the project is to automate various domestic appliances, which would improve the comfort of living for a reasonable price.
