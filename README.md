# Home-automation
Author: Rihards Belinskis

Last update: November 2nd, 2018.

All files within this repository are written for the home automation project. The project is made for the purpose of exploring the possibilities of the RPi and to showcase that home automation can be achieved with reasonably low price equipment.

The project includes (or will include) the following subfolders:

* Surveillance
* Lighting
* Speakers
* Gardening

Each of the folders contains scripts and instructions for hardware and software, which are used to create the particular automated system. Prior to copying and running the python / bash scripts, read the .txt files for required hardware, required repos as well as other instructions (e.g. crontab commands).

The list, as well as the project is still to be updated. The goal of the project is to automate various domestic appliances, which would improve the comfort of living for a reasonable price.
